Credit Card Manager is the fourth and final project of the GA Software Engineer Immersive.


# User Story

As a user, I can:
- create an account
- login to my account
- log off from my account
- create credit-card instances 
- for each credit-card instance, I can enter 
    - name
    - account number
    - bank
    - bank address for payment remittance 
    - costumer-service information
    - credit limit
    - current balance
    - due date
    - minimum payment
    - interest rate
    - annual fee (if any)
- see how much I am paying monthly in total credit card debt
- see how long it will take to pay off the credit card balance if I only pay the minimum payment
- see how much I need to pay monthly if I want to pay off the credit card balance by a given date
- see the impact that a larger monthly payment will have in the payment time and in the interest I will end up paying by the time the credit card is paid off.
- see a graph that compares the pay-off time of a credit card if I only pay the minimum balance vs. making accelerated payments
- see how much I will pay in interest by the time I pay the credit-card balance if I only pay the minimum payment required
- see a graph that compares how much interest and how much principal I will pay over the payoff period at minimum payment
- see a graph that compares how much interest and how much principal I will pay over the payoff period with accelerated payments
- see how much I will pay in interest by the time I pay the credit card balance if I accelerate payments.
- see my total credit-card debt
- update the information of any credit card instance	
- delete any of the credit card instances
